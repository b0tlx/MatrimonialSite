                <h3>Ankit and Ayushi.</h3>
                <p >For Ankit, one visit back home to India in 2022 changed everything. After coming <br>  across Aayushi’s profile on billsbond.com and  being impressed by their mutually aligned <br> preferences, he was able to easily connect with her father. From then on, one conversation turned <br> into many conversations. The families met, phone numbers were exchanged, and the <br> bond was deepened over the next six months. On his next trip to India, Ankit <br> went on a trip with Ayushi to Jaipur, cementing their love with vows for a lifetime. <br> Thus, through Shaadi.com, what was a distance of thousands of miles between the two perfect <br> soulmates was reduced to nothing. That laid the successful foundation of their marriage in 2024.</p>
